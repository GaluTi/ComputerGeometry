# This is a Qt program that implements several tasks at once:
1) Construction of a convex hull using the Jarvis algorithm;
2) Construction of Triangulation by a greedy algorithm;
3) The intersection of convex polygons, but so far it does not work;
4) Ray tracing on sphere and pyramid;
5) Interpolation by Lagrange polynomial, interpolation by Hermite polynomials, interpolation by cuic splines, and construction of a Bezier curve.
You can add points by clicking and move them, the program is updated in real time.
